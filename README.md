**Amplify^**
Unity In Human

Write an Algorithm that Connects all available data to their context with the conecting points provided as clues for organizing the data by context so it can be used to promote awareness. 

**Context:** 
A series of text describing the experiences that inspired a series of tweet are stored in a chat history between <240.351.3678> and <+2348188345257> {This chat history will continue updating until either parties decide to seize communication} 


**Data**: 
TwitterAPI: Tweets containing #LafiaEscape and #Amplify^ 
WhatsApp And Google Location History: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UbI8qpqE4XajfenrTP1tq2VB7NU4Bt5G?usp=sharing 

**Solve these problems:**
1. What does 6 represent when this tweet #Amplify^6 was first posted on twitter? 
2. Persona 1 = {Data: <WhatsApp Messages> on the < LafiaEscapeStartDate>
3. Persona 2 = {Data: <WhatsApp Messages> on the October 1, 2021>
4. In What location was the 1st #LafiaEscape posted (GoogleMap API: <Date: Oct 8th 2021) 
5. What Date did #LafiaEscape Matured? <date #Amplify^ made it on twitter through #LafiaEscape> 

**Store this value as Context (Bonus: Visualize this):**
var AmplifyContext: <#LafiaEscape Tweet on 12/01/2021>
var AmplifyActions: <WhatsAppMessage on 12/15/2022>
LafiaEscapeStartDate: <Date of 1st #LafiaEscape> 
LafiaEscapeConnectDate: (Location City {GoogleMap API}: <LafiaEscapeStartDate:> ) 

Visualization:
(Graph AmplifyContext backward using #lafiaEscape as context) or 
Display: <WhatsAppMessage on 12/1/2021> 
(Graph AmplifyContext Forward using #Amplify^ as context)

**Your Algorithm will be tested for: **

Speed to build the history of #Amplify^ <You can compare to the top ranking algorithm> 

Creative visualization and ability to communicate with the available data 

Only solution deploy to cloud will be accepted
